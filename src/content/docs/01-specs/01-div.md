In order to avoid cumbersome and confusing repetition of expressions in these specifications, it is provided that whenever anything is, or is to be done, if, as, or, when, or where “contemplated, required, determined, directed, specified, authorized, ordered, given, designated, indicated, considered necessary, deemed necessary, permitted, reserved, suspended, established, approval, approved, disapproved, acceptable, unacceptable, suitable, accepted, satisfactory, unsatisfactory, sufficient, insufficient, rejected, or condemned,” it shall be understood as if the expression were followed by the words “by the Engineer” or “to the Engineer.”

Wherever in these specifications or other contract documents the following terms or pronouns in
place of them are used, the intent and meaning shall be interpreted as follows:

### Subsection 1.02: References, Abbreviations, Acronyms, Measurement Units and Symbols

#### A. References
Section and Subsection titles and headings provide reference only, not interpretation. A cross reference to a specific Subsection of these Specifications includes all general requirements of the
Section of which the Subsection is a part.
Where codes, standards, requirements or publications of public or private bodies are referred to in
the Contract Documents, references shall be understood to be to the latest revision in effect on the
date of opening of bids, except where otherwise indicated. Words and abbreviations which have
well-known technical or trade meanings are used in the Contract Documents in accordance with
such recognized meanings.

#### B. Abbreviations and Acronyms
Wherever the following abbreviations and acronyms are used in these specifications or on the
plans, they are to be construed as the same as the respective expressions represented:

|Abbreviation|Description|
|-|-|
|AAB|Massachusetts Architectural Access Board|
|NTP|Notice to Proceed|

#### C. Measurement Units and Symbols
These Specifications provide measurements in U.S. Customary Units and, where needed, in the
International System of Units, abbreviated as SI and commonly referred to as the metric system.
Where both units are listed, U.S. Customary Units appear first, followed by SI units in parentheses.
To specify sizes, dimensions, and similar properties, the Department may use symbols for units of
measurement. These symbols are defined in Table 1.02-1.

Department.
